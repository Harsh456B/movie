Movie Recommendation System
This Movie Recommendation System utilizes machine learning techniques and a pre-trained model to recommend personalized movies to users based on their preferences. The system is deployed with Streamlit to provide an interactive web interface for users to enter their preferences and get movie suggestions. The system uses a .pkl file for storing and loading the trained recommendation model.

Features
Personalized Recommendations: The system recommends movies based on user input (e.g., movie name, genre).
Collaborative Filtering: Uses user interaction data (such as ratings or watched movies) to find similarities between users and recommend movies.
Content-Based Filtering: Suggests movies based on features such as genre, director, and actors.
Hybrid Approach: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering methods to improve accuracy.
Streamlit Interface: Easy-to-use web interface for interacting with the recommendation system.
Technologies Used
Python 3.x: Programming language.
Streamlit: Web application framework for deploying the app.
Pickle: For saving and loading the trained model.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn: For building and training machine learning models.
Surprise: For building recommendation algorithms (optional, if using surprise library).
MovieLens Dataset: Dataset of movie ratings and metadata (optional, depending on your system).
Installation
Prerequisites
Install Python (preferably version 3.8+). You can download it from here.
Install pip (Python package manager) if not already installed.
Clone the Repository
Clone the repository from GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
To avoid dependency issues, create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies
Install all required libraries by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare the Model File
Ensure you have the pre-trained recommendation model stored as a .pkl file (e.g., movie_recommendation_model.pkl). This model should be trained using data such as MovieLens or any dataset you have.

Prepare Your Dataset (Optional)
If your system requires a dataset for movie metadata (e.g., movie titles, genres, etc.), place it in the project directory (e.g., movies.csv).

Usage
Running the Streamlit App Locally
To run the recommendation system locally, follow these steps:

Make sure your .pkl file (trained model) and dataset (if applicable) are placed in the project folder.

Run the following command to start the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Streamlit will automatically open a browser window or provide a local URL (usually http://localhost:8501) where you can interact with the recommendation system.

Input
The system allows users to input a movie name or genre, and based on this input, it will provide movie recommendations.

Movie Name: Users can enter the name of a movie they like or have watched, and the system will suggest similar movies.
Genre: Users can enter a genre (e.g., "Action", "Comedy"), and the system will recommend movies from that genre.
Output
The system will display a list of recommended movies based on the user's input, such as:

Movie titles
Movie ratings (optional)
Genre(s) of the recommended movies
File Structure

├── app.py                  # Streamlit app script
├── recommendation_model.pkl # Trained model file
├── movies.csv              # Dataset with movie details (optional)

Example Flow
User Input: The user enters a movie name or genre in the input field.
Model Prediction: The system loads the pre-trained model (movie_recommendation_model.pkl), processes the input, and returns a list of recommended movies.
Output: The recommended movies are displayed on the Streamlit interface.
Deployment on Streamlit Cloud
GitHub Repository: Push your project to GitHub.
Streamlit Cloud: Create an account on Streamlit Cloud.
Deploy:
Link your GitHub repository to Streamlit Cloud.
Streamlit will automatically detect the necessary files (app.py and requirements.txt) and deploy the app.
Visit the provided URL to interact with the app online.
Troubleshooting
Model not loading properly: Ensure that the model file (.pkl) is in the correct directory and is compatible with the code (check for compatibility issues between versions of libraries used during training and deployment).
Missing dependencies: Make sure all dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt and installed in the environment.
