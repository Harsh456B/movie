###Movie Recommendation System
Overview
The Movie Recommendation System uses machine learning techniques to recommend movies based on user preferences. The system utilizes collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a hybrid model to suggest personalized movie recommendations. It is deployed using Streamlit to provide an interactive web interface. The system uses a pre-trained model saved in a .pkl file to generate recommendations.
Features
•	Personalized Movie Recommendations: Recommends movies based on user input, such as movie names or genres.
•	Collaborative Filtering: Suggests movies based on user ratings and preferences.
•	Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on metadata like genre, director, and actors.
•	Hybrid Model: Combines both collaborative and content-based filtering for more accurate recommendations.
•	Web Interface with Streamlit: Easy-to-use front-end interface to interact with the recommendation system.
Technologies Used
•	Python: The programming language used for model training and web app development.
•	Streamlit: For creating the interactive web application.
•	Pickle: For saving and loading the pre-trained recommendation model.
•	Scikit-learn: For building machine learning models (if applicable).
•	Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
•	NumPy: For numerical operations.
•	MovieLens Dataset (optional): A dataset of movie ratings and metadata used for training the model.
Installation
Prerequisites
•	Python 3.x: Download and install Python from here.
•	Pip: Python package manager should be installed. You can check if pip is installed using:
bash
Copy code
pip --version
Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
•	Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
•	macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies
Install all required dependencies using the following command:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install the necessary libraries such as streamlit, pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.
Model File
Ensure that you have the pre-trained movie recommendation model saved as a .pkl file (e.g., movie_recommendation_model.pkl). If the model isn't available, you can train one and save it using Python's pickle module:
python
Copy code
import pickle

# Assuming `model` is your trained recommendation model
with open('movie_recommendation_model.pkl', 'wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(model, file)
Dataset (Optional)
If your recommendation system requires movie metadata (e.g., movie titles, genres, etc.), ensure you have a CSV file (e.g., movies.csv) containing this data in the project directory.
Usage
Running Locally
To run the Movie Recommendation System locally:
1.	Ensure you have your .pkl model and dataset (if necessary) in the project directory.
2.	Run the Streamlit app with the following command:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
3.	This will open the app in your default browser (usually at http://localhost:8501), where you can interact with the recommendation system.
Web Interface
•	Input: The user can input a movie name or genre in the text field.
•	Output: The app will display a list of recommended movies based on the input.

Deployment
Deploy on Streamlit Cloud
1.	Create a GitHub Repository: Upload your project to GitHub, including all necessary files (e.g., app.py, recommendation_model.pkl, requirements.txt).
2.	Sign up for Streamlit Cloud: Create an account on Streamlit Cloud if you don't have one.
3.	Link Your Repository: After signing up, click on "New app", link your GitHub repository, and deploy the app.
4.	Automatic Deployment: Streamlit will automatically detect the necessary files (app.py and requirements.txt) and deploy the app to a public URL.
5.	Visit the URL provided by Streamlit to interact with your app online.
